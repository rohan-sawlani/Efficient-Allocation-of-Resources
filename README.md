# Efficient Allocation of Resources

**Project under the guidance of Prof. Soumyarup Sadhukan, IIT Kanpur**

This repository explores strategic allocation mechanisms by modifying classical axiomatic structures and designing new algorithmic frameworks that ensure fairness, efficiency, and incentive compatibility in resource allocation settings.

## üöÄ Objective

To reformulate allocation rules by introducing a **Pareto-efficiency-preserving constraint**, and analyze the resulting mechanisms for their strategic robustness.

## üìå Summary

- Analyzed the impact of altered axioms on allocation rules such as **Smart Reverse Rejecting Rules**, focusing on properties like **strategy-proofness** and **non-bossiness**.
- Modeled allocation environments as **non-cooperative games**, leveraging tools such as **Nash equilibrium**, **mixed strategies**, and **extensive-form representations**.
- Designed an **algorithmic mechanism** to compute **Pareto optimal** matchings within restricted strategic domains.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Topics & Concepts Used

- Pareto Efficiency & Social Choice Theory  
- Axiomatic Mechanism Design  
- Strategy-proofness and Non-bossiness  
- Game Theory (Nash Equilibria, Mixed Strategies)  
- Matching Algorithms and Mechanism Simulation

## üß† Motivation

Real-world allocation problems (e.g., auctions, school choice, healthcare distribution) often require mechanisms that balance **efficiency**, **fairness**, and **strategic simplicity**. This project seeks to contribute theoretical insights and algorithmic solutions that bridge economic principles with computational feasibility.
